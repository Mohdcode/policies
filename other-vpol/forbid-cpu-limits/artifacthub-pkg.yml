displayName: Forbid CPU Limits in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Setting of CPU limits is a debatable poor practice as it can result, when defined, in potentially starving applications of much-needed CPU cycles even when they are available. Ensuring that CPU limits are not set may ensure apps run more effectively. This policy forbids any container in a Pod from defining CPU limits.
