version: 1.0.0
displayName: Disallow all Secrets in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  Secrets often contain sensitive information which not all Pods need consume. This policy disables the use of all Secrets in a Pod definition. In order to work effectively, this Policy needs a separate Policy or rule to require `automountServiceAccountToken=false` at the Pod level or ServiceAccount level since this would otherwise result in a Secret being mounted.
