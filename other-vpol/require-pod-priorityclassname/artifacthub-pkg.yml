displayName: Require Pod priorityClassName in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  A Pod may optionally specify a priorityClassName which indicates the scheduling priority relative to others. This requires creation of a PriorityClass object in advance. With this created, a Pod may set this field to that value. In a multi-tenant environment, it is often desired to require this priorityClassName be set to make certain tenant scheduling guarantees. This policy requires that a Pod defines the priorityClassName field with some value.
