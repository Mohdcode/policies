displayName: Require imagePullPolicy Always in ValidatingPolicy
description: >-
  If the `latest` tag is allowed for images, it is a good idea to have the imagePullPolicy field set to `Always` to ensure should that tag be overwritten that future pulls will get the updated image. This policy validates the imagePullPolicy is set to `Always` when the `latest` tag is specified explicitly or where a tag is not defined at all.
